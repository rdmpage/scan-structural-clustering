My code is crude, the Javascript is embedded in `index.html`, results shown in console, lots of tidying up to do. Makes heavy use of [cpettitt/graphlib](https://github.com/cpettitt/graphlib). Hope to package this along the lines of [Weighted cliques](https://linen-baseball.glitch.me).

The goal is to use this algorithm to implement something like:
